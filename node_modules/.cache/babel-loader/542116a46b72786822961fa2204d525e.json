The control elements were the play button, sliders for volume and playback rate, skip buttons, and the scrub or progress bar. I was able to do everything but the last. I couldn't figure out the progress bar as I didn't know how to detect when the time is changing so I ended up following along the tutorial for it.

Well, I learned something new at least. And today, I followed a couple of tutorials on Angular. I learned how to create a new Angular app, the main files to work with, how to bind event handlers and classes, routing within the app, and how to create a build for production. Angular is TypeScript-based so I learned a bit about that as well.

For today's JavaScript 30 challenge, I got a chance to brush up on the canvas and learned a few things: dynamically changing the hue and line width as well as using blend mode. By using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values, I'm able to increment a variable for the hue from 1 to 360 and back to 1 again. The line width increments up to a certain value and then decrements down to 1 repeatedly. And with mouse events, I was able to update a variable's boolean value to indicate when to start and when to end a drawing. I also did the next challenge and learned about some dev tools and console tricks. Sometimes you can be looking at a code on a browser and you're wondering what JavaScript logic is causing the change on an element. What you can do is inspect the page and right click on the element, then go to 'Break on...' and select 'attribute modifications'. And now when you click on the element, it's going to pause exactly where the line of code that causes the logic is. Other than console.log(), there are other ways you can log things: interpolated, styled, warning, error, info, testing, clearing, viewing DOM elements, grouping together, counting, timing, and table. I've used a couple of these and today I've learned the rest. 'Tis a good day :)\",gif:'https://j.gifs.com/jZDQY4.gif'},{id:12,date:'10/27/20 1:58PM',title:'Array Cardio Day 2',copy:\"Had some more practice with array methods for today's JavaScript 30 challenge. I'm familiar with the methods some() and every(), but haven't really used them yet in any projects. Though I know they'll be useful someday. Some() method takes in a function and checks if any of the items in the array pass a test. It returns true as long as one item returns a true value. Every() on the other hand, only returns true if all the items in the array return true. Other methods for today's challenge were find() and findIndex(), which I've used a few times. Find() takes in function and looks for the first item that passes a test and then returns it. FindIndex(), on the other hand, returns only the index of the first item that passes a test. The last part of this challenge was to remove the item of the given index from the array. With splice(), this can be done by passing in the given index and a value of 1, but this will modify the original array as well. To preserve the original array, you can use the spread operator to create a new array, which you would then use the splice() method on. Or you could also use the spread operator and the slice() method. The slice() method returns the selected items without changing the original array. So with slice() method, you would select index 0 to the given index, and select everything else above the given index.\",image:js30ArrayCardio2},{id:11,date:'10/26/20 5:30PM',title:'Ajax Type Ahead',copy:\"Today's JavaScript 30 challenge is a small City Search application that also highlights the search value in the results.

It does make updating certain values a lot easier when you create a variable for it. For example, creating a variable for a primary color on your site avoids having to copy and paste it over and over again. Creating a variable allows you to also change it with JavaScript, which is what today's JavaScript 30 challenge was about. Using sliders for spacing, blur, and color, I added change and mouseover events to handle the change in values. Each of the slider inputs have a 'name' attribute that corresponds to the css variables I've created.

We have created some of the tables and schemas already on Google Cloud and will continue to create the rest.\",image:currentProjects},{id:2,date:'10/11/20 7:45PM',title:'Grid CSS',copy:\"There are times, like today, when I look through my portfolio site and wonder what I can do to make it look better either by implementing something I just learned or something else I want a bit more practice with. I chose to update my about section using Grid CSS, which I've delved into a while back but never really used it much recently. I wanted the div that contains the text to overlap part of the dark background from the section above it and remain responsive on mobile. Using Grid, I defined the parent element to be the grid container with 3 rows of 100px, 100px, and auto height respectively and 3 columns of 25%, auto, and 25% width respectively. I then defined a div element as one item that takes in the same dark backgorund color as the previous section. This covers the first 2 whole rows. The div containing the text is the other item which covers the middle column of the second row as to overlap the dark background and expands to the height of its contents.\",image:gridCss},{id:1,date:'10/10/20 11:23PM',title:'Posts Page',copy:\"I decided to create a page for my posts on my site instead of posting on social media like LinkedIn. This is more for me to record things I feel are post worthy. So here is my first post regarding this page itself and its future contents. Here you'll find posts on new things I've just learned, tutorials, recent achievements, projects, and more.\"}];var projects=[{title:'ChampUnite',description:'A full-stack MERN game app where users go

These buttons should delete all, uncheck all, and check all items respectively and keep the data persistent. For the delete all logic, I set the items array into an empty one, populated the list with it, and removed the items key from the localStorage.

I couldn't figure out the progress bar as I didn't know how to detect when the time is changing so I ended up following along the tutorial for it.

Well, I learned something new at least. And today, I followed a couple of tutorials on Angular. I learned how to create a new Angular app, the main files to work with, how to bind event handlers and classes, routing within the app, and how to create a build for production. Angular is TypeScript-based so I learned a bit about that as well.

For today's JavaScript 30 challenge, I got a chance to brush up on the canvas and learned a few things: dynamically changing the hue and line width as well as using blend mode. By using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values, I'm able to increment a variable for the hue from 1 to 360 and back to 1 again. The line width increments up to a certain value and then decrements down to 1 repeatedly. And with mouse events, I was able to update a variable's boolean value to indicate when to start and when to end a drawing. I also did the next challenge and learned about some dev tools and console tricks. Sometimes you can be looking at a code on a browser and you're wondering what JavaScript logic is causing the change on an element. What you can do is inspect the page and right click on the element, then go to 'Break on...' and select 'attribute modifications'. And now when you click on the element, it's going to pause exactly where the line of code that causes the logic is. Other than console.log(), there are other ways you can log things: interpolated, styled, warning, error, info, testing, clearing, viewing DOM elements, grouping together, counting, timing, and table. I've used a couple of these and today I've learned the rest.

I'm familiar with the methods some() and every(), but haven't really used them yet in any projects. Though I know they'll be useful someday. Some() method takes in a function and checks if any of the items in the array pass a test. It returns true as long as one item returns a true value. Every() on the other hand, only returns true if all the items in the array return true. Other methods for today's challenge were find() and findIndex(), which I've used a few times. Find() takes in function and looks for the first item that passes a test and then returns it. FindIndex(), on the other hand, returns only the index of the first item that passes a test. The last part of this challenge was to remove the item of the given index from the array. With splice(), this can be done by passing in the given index and a value of 1, but this will modify the original array as well. To preserve the original array, you can use the spread operator to create a new array, which you would then use the splice() method on. Or you could also use the spread operator and the slice() method. The slice() method returns the selected items without changing the original array. So with slice() method, you would select index 0 to the given index, and select everything else above the given index.\",\n    image: js30ArrayCardio2\n  },\n  {\n    id: 11,\n    date: '10/26/20 5:30PM',\n    title: 'Ajax Type Ahead',\n    copy:\n      \"Today's JavaScript 30 challenge is a small City Search application that also highlights the search value in the results.

Creating a variable allows you to also change it with JavaScript, which is what today's JavaScript 30 challenge was about. Using sliders for spacing, blur, and color, I added change and mouseover events to handle the change in values. Each of the slider inputs have a 'name' attribute that corresponds to the css variables I've created.

I then defined a div element as one item that takes in the same dark backgorund color as the previous section. This covers the first 2 whole rows.
