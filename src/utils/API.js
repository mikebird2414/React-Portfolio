      "Had my very first mid-year review at work today. I was happy to find out that I've been doing well. I can't express enough how much I appreciate being given the opportunity to start my new career at Ibotta. Everyone has been nothing but supportive. From the review, I do need to improve on asking for help when I'm working on a task and have reached an impasse. I tend to take too much time trying to figure such a task out on my own at times. I have to remember my colleagues are all willing to help given the opportunity. Aside from the review, I've finished my current project's (My Expense Tracker) MVP. There's still a bit of polishing left to do, but I'm happy where this is at right now. I will start using this in July to track my expenses.",

These elements can also be toggled by a click of a button.',

The new thing I learned is that you can actually remove the event after it's been handled once.

When the y position of the page is equal to or greater than the top of the nav, add a 'fixed-nav' class to the body, otherwise remove the class. This class was then used to update the position property of the nav from relative to sticky. It was also used to update the logo's max-width so it animates in and to update the scale of the white div so it zooms in.",

For today's JavaScript 30 challenge, I got a chance to brush up on the canvas and learned a few things: dynamically changing the hue and line width as well as using blend mode. By using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color values, I'm able to increment a variable for the hue from 1 to 360 and back to 1 again. The line width increments up to a certain value and then decrements down to 1 repeatedly. And with mouse events, I was able to update a variable's boolean value to indicate when to start and when to end a drawing. I also did the next challenge and learned about some dev tools and console tricks. Sometimes you can be looking at a code on a browser and you're wondering what JavaScript logic is causing the change on an element. What you can do is inspect the page and right click on the element, then go to 'Break on...' and select 'attribute modifications'. And now when you click on the element, it's going to pause exactly where the line of code that causes the logic is. Other than console.log(), there are other ways you can log things: interpolated, styled, warning, error, info, testing, clearing, viewing DOM elements, grouping together, counting, timing, and table. I've used a couple of these and today I've learned the rest. 'Tis a good day :)",

      "Had some more practice with array methods for today's JavaScript 30 challenge. I'm familiar with the methods some() and every(), but haven't really used them yet in any projects. Though I know they'll be useful someday. Some() method takes in a function and checks if any of the items in the array pass a test. It returns true as long as one item returns a true value. Every() on the other hand, only returns true if all the items in the array return true. Other methods for today's challenge were find() and findIndex(), which I've used a few times. Find() takes in function and looks for the first item that passes a test and then returns it. FindIndex(), on the other hand, returns only the index of the first item that passes a test. The last part of this challenge was to remove the item of the given index from the array. With splice(), this can be done by passing in the given index and a value of 1, but this will modify the original array as well. To preserve the original array, you can use the spread operator to create a new array, which you would then use the splice() method on. Or you could also use the spread operator and the slice() method. The slice() method returns the selected items without changing the original array. So with slice() method, you would select index 0 to the given index, and select everything else above the given index.",

Using an API endpoint, I first fetched the cities and pushed them into an empty array. Then I created a function that accepts the search term and cities array as arguments. Using regex on the search term, I filtered through the cities array and returned the results. I created another function that maps over the matches, returns string literals for each item, and displays the results on the DOM.",

The nice thing about this challenge being a recorded video is that I'm able to pause the video and try the exercises myself before I see the solutions. I'm proficient in filter and map, so I only really needed to look up sort and reduce to brush up on them. The last exercise of summing up the instances of each of the items in an array using reduce was new to me. I'll be keeping this one in mind for when an opportunity to use it arises.",

      "I have some experience with CSS variables, but I admit I don't use it as often as I should. It does make updating certain values a lot easier when you create a variable for it. For example, creating a variable for a primary color on your site avoids having to copy and paste it over and over again. Creating a variable allows you to also change it with JavaScript, which is what today's JavaScript 30 challenge was about. Using sliders for spacing, blur, and color, I added change and mouseover events to handle the change in values. Each of the slider inputs have a 'name' attribute that corresponds to the css variables I've created. So everytime a certain slider is changed, it updates the correct variable value.",

Our goal is to turn this into a functional application using the MERN stack. We've finished most of the UIs and will soon tackle the logic behind each page.

I chose to update my about section using Grid CSS, which I've delved into a while back but never really used it much recently. I wanted the div that contains the text to overlap part of the dark background from the section above it and remain responsive on mobile. Using Grid, I defined the parent element to be the grid container with 3 rows of 100px, 100px, and auto height respectively and 3 columns of 25%, auto, and 25% width respectively. I then defined a div element as one item that takes in the same dark backgorund color as the previous section. This covers the first 2 whole rows. The div containing the text is the other item which covers the middle column of the second row as to overlap the dark background and expands to the height of its contents.",
