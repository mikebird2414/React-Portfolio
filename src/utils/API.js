      "Had my very first mid-year review at work today. I was happy to find out that I've been doing well. I can't express enough how much I appreciate being given the opportunity to start my new career at Ibotta. Everyone has been nothing but supportive. From the review, I do need to improve on asking for help when I'm working on a task and have reached an impasse. I tend to take too much time trying to figure such a task out on my own at times. I have to remember my colleagues are all willing to help given the opportunity. Aside from the review, I've finished my current project's (My Expense Tracker) MVP. There's still a bit of polishing left to do, but I'm happy where this is at right now. I will start using this in July to track my expenses.",

It has been months since I've really created a web app from scratch so before I forget things, I decided I'd create one that I would also use. This would allow me to keep track of my spending so I can better manage my finance. To continue expanding my frontend skills, I'm using a new css framework and a new way of implementing it as well. You can check out my github repo @ https://github.com/aroblesgalit/my-expense-tracker and a demo @ https://my-expense-tracker-web-app.herokuapp.com/"

It also separates the logic for each component into its own JS file, which then get imported into one game JS file. I added a few extra things on top of what was provided in the tutorial: a level select that changes the speed of the snake and the amount that the body of the snake grows, a scoreboard that shows your score based on the length of the snake, and a highscore board showing the top 3 scores. These elements can also be toggled by a click of a button.',

I was able to do the first part of making the nav sticky and just followed along for the rest. The idea was to compare the values of the top of the nav and the y position of the page. When the y position of the page is equal to or greater than the top of the nav, add a 'fixed-nav' class to the body, otherwise remove the class. This class was then used to update the position property of the nav from relative to sticky. It was also used to update the logo's max-width so it animates in and to update the scale of the white div so it zooms in.",

      "I have some experience with CSS variables, but I admit I don't use it as often as I should. It does make updating certain values a lot easier when you create a variable for it. For example, creating a variable for a primary color on your site avoids having to copy and paste it over and over again. Creating a variable allows you to also change it with JavaScript, which is what today's JavaScript 30 challenge was about. Using sliders for spacing, blur, and color, I added change and mouseover events to handle the change in values. Each of the slider inputs have a 'name' attribute that corresponds to the css variables I've created. So everytime a certain slider is changed, it updates the correct variable value.",
